The questionnaire offered answers with three grade of importance. Our research showed that groups of students formed on the basis of their education and gender, in our survey considered as representatives of young adults, had different interest for selected set of information included in the statements connected with food quality, safety and food choice. The results showed that there is a need for better informing and education of consumers about food quality and safety, labels and labeling, and how to use and interpret labels content. The results of research represent a qualitative set of information related to the food preference, which could be useful for creation and development guidelines for consumers’ better informing and education.},

Initial samples were collected by citizen scientists recruited via social media, a relatively unusual approach for a sample collection project. Participants in the affected areas collected 63 usable samples from basements, gardens, roads, and beaches. Results indicate high levels of arsenic, lead, PCBs, and PAHs in an area approximately 800 feet south of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) Superfund site at Newtown Creek. A location adjacent to the Gowanus Canal, another Superfund site, was found to have high PCB concentrations. Areas of high PAH contamination tended to be near high traffic areas or next to sites of known contamination. While contamination as a direct result of Hurricane Sandy cannot be demonstrated conclusively, the presence of high levels of contamination close to known contamination sites, evidence for co-contamination, and decrease in number of samples containing measureable amounts of semi-volatile compounds from samples collected at similar locations 9 months after the storm suggest that contaminated particles may have migrated to residential areas as a result of flooding.},

	doi = {10.1002/wat2.1138},
	abstract = {The proliferation of citizen science water quality monitoring networks suggests there is potential for developing an equivalent river Restoration Assessment Initiative (RAI). This is currently lacking, especially at larger (e.g., national and international) scales. As such, the RAI would provide a much-needed new tool for stakeholders to evaluate and compare the efficacy of their restoration efforts. We propose a standardized protocol to quantify biotic responses (e.g., changes to the macroinvertebrate community) to restoration efforts, which would facilitate a large-scale, open-access database revealing success or failure of commonly used restoration techniques. By combining biotic and abiotic (e.g., habitat and water quality) assessments, a feature typically lacking from restoration monitoring schemes and cited as a major constraint limiting development of the field, integrative approaches (e.g., meta-analyses and coordinated field experiments) could help untangle their respective effects on restoration outcomes. Water quality initiatives (e.g., the Riverfly Monitoring Initiative) have paved the way for volunteer-driven pollution monitoring, and provide models designed for sustaining long-lasting volunteer participation in stream monitoring. These could be developed for the RAI to better detect restoration signals (e.g., adopt a before-after-control-impact (BACI) approach) while continuing to address the key practical challenges associated with implementing citizen science initiatives (e.g., volunteer skills and data quality assurance). Once established, the resultant infrastructure would facilitate expansion to an international scale, increasing the statistical power of the combined database enormously and allowing the addition of novel measures (e.g., ecosystem process rates) for assessing restoration. Clearly citizen scientists need a role in restoration assessment, especially as they are becoming increasingly important drivers of practices on the ground. Developing a coordinated citizen science RAI to ensure data are standardized and disseminated effectively will advance restoration on a more global scale, and also provides a timely solution to keep society and science connected.

	abstract = {The modern food environment is considered a primary driver of obesity and other nutrition-related chronic diseases. A significant contribution to this environment is the proliferation of claims on food packaging that provides a misleading picture of a product's healthfulness. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the agency responsible for food labels but it lacks the regulatory authority and adequate resources to address the majority of questionable labeling practices. The FDA's current system of enforcement is thus essentially based on voluntary compliance and consumer- and manufacturer-initiated litigation has not successfully filled the regulatory gap. This manuscript reviews the current state of food labeling claims and the FDA's inadequate authority over misbranded food products. It analyzes competing views on regulatory compliance strategies and argues that a regulatory overhaul consistent with the best science and the First Amendment is necessary. With increased resources and authority, the FDA can meet current public health challenges and adequately ensure that labels are clear and consumers are properly informed and protected.},

Their analysis indicates that, though much in the new labeling rules is likely to improve consumer information, a number of important features of the rules raise concerns that the provision of key types of information that could be used to improve food choices will be deterred. The authors attempt to highlight those issues for which evidence would be most useful in informing the policy debate as the labeling rules are refined and food advertising policy is adapted to harmonize with the labeling rules.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Our objectives were to assess the performance of the 5-Colour nutrition label (5-CNL) front-of-pack nutrition label based on the Food Standards Agency nutrient profiling system to discriminate nutritional quality of foods currently on the market in France and its consistency with French nutritional recommendations. Methods: Nutritional composition of 7777 foods available on the French market collected from the web-based collaborative project Open Food Facts were retrieved. Distribution of products across the 5-CNL categories according to food groups, as arranged in supermarket shelves was assessed. Distribution of similar products from different brands in the 5-CNL categories was also assessed. Discriminating performance was considered as the number of color categories present in each food group. In the case of discrepancies between the category allocation and French nutritional recommendations, adaptations of the original score were proposed. Results: Overall, the distribution of foodstuffs in the 5-CNL categories was consistent with French recommendations: 95.4 \% of 'Fruits and vegetables', 72.5 \% of 'Cereals and potatoes' were classified as 'Green' or 'Yellow' whereas 86.0 \% of 'Sugary snacks' were classified as 'Pink' or 'Red'. Adaptations to the original FSA score computation model were necessary for beverages, added fats and cheese in order to be consistent with French official nutritional recommendations. Conclusion: The 5-CNL label displays a high performance in discriminating nutritional quality of foods across food groups, within a food group and for similar products from different brands. Adaptations from the original model were necessary to maintain consistency with French recommendations and high performance of the system.},

	abstract = {Western consumers are increasingly demanding to know the provenance of their food. In New Zealand, Maori tribal enterprises are engaged in the food producing sectors of farming and fisheries and, like other businesses seeking to remain competitive in global markets, are responding to the demand for provenance through developing systems for communicating the origin of foods to consumers. However, Maori are doing this in their own way, in a manner that authentically reflects their own understanding of place and expresses an indigenous animist perspective. It is argued that an animist approach to provenancing provides an authentic means of connecting Western consumers to nature in circumstances where they have become psychologically and physically abstracted. Animism provides a relational way of understanding the world, through which food products emerge as animated representations of reciprocal place-based relationships. It is considered that this indigenous approach can provide 'an antidote' to the alienating effects of modernity, where food products are experienced as inert compositions of elements that can be replicated and produced anywhere via industrial processes. Furthermore, it can provide a touchstone for differentiating between authentic provenance and the cynical use of provenance marketing that exploits the needs of alienated individuals for connection to place. A case study of indigenous provenance, Ahika Kai, is offered to explain and illustrate the theoretical perspectives provided.},

	abstract = {La consom’action ou consommation responsable est un néologisme qui exprime cette idée selon laquelle on peut « voter avec son caddie » en choisissant à qui l'on donne son argent, en choisissant de consommer de façon citoyenne et non plus seulement de manière consumériste.
Le consom'acteur ou la consom'actrice est un consommateur qui décide d'utiliser consciemment son pouvoir d'achat pour défendre les idées en lesquelles il/elle croit. Dans le contexte actuel devenir consom'acteur peut par exemple se manifester par les choix suivants : acheter bio, des produits issus de commerce équitable, éviter les produits sur-emballés, favoriser le commerce de proximité etc. L'entreprise qui vend des produits rattachés à la Consom'action défendra le concept de « décroissance douce », en proposant des produits écologiques et éco-durables innovants. Selon Michel Bogé, président de l’association Consomacteurs, il s'agit de promouvoir l’écologie par l’économie. Nous sommes dans une Economie coupée du vivant, contrairement à la Consom'action qui prône une Economie vivante (proche de la nature, etc).

	abstract = {Many jurisdictions around the world have deregulated utilities and opened retail markets to competition. However, inertial decisionmaking can diminish consumer benefits of retail competition. Using household-level data from the Texas residential electricity market, we document evidence of consumer inertia. We estimate an econometric model of retail choice to measure two sources of inertia: (1) search frictions/inattention, and (2) a brand advantage that consumers afford the incumbent. We find that households rarely search for alternative retailers, and when they do search, households attach a brand advantage to the incumbent. Counterfactual experiments show that low-cost information interventions can notably increase consumer surplus.},
